Three Stages of Git

# Working Directory
    Everything that is not saved lives here
    Area where all of our files and directories and changes ar living all the time

# Staging Area
    Stage fixes into staging area in order to get ready to commit them
    Files and directories that we explicitly add to the staging area

# .git Repository
    Commit to this to save it
    Where all our snapshots are stored
